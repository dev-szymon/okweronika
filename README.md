Simple blog written as a SPA in vanilla javascript. 
It should probably be rewritten to split it into components but it was sufficient for the need of my sister. She needed it for her classes. 
Transfered it to her github and deployed using github pages just because it needed her name in the domain name.
I add and remove classes with event listeners. 
It is responsive and works well on mobile and desktop.
